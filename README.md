Medical Deep Learning 2D high resolution image segmentation project: MICCAI 2019 Prostate Cancer segmentation challenge



## Usage
### 1. Open miccai.ipynb in Google Colab
1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com
2. **```File```** > **```Upload notebook...```** > **```GitHub```** > **```Paste this link:``` https://github.com/black0017/MICCAI-2019-Prostate-Cancer-segmentation-challenge/blob/master/MICCAI_2019.ipynb**
3. Ensure that **```Runtime```** > **```Change runtime type```** is ```Python 3``` with ```GPU```
### 2. Initial imports, install, initializations
Second step is to install all the required dependencies. Select the first and second code cells and push ```shift+enter```. You'll see running lines of executing code. Wait until it's done (1-2 minutes).
